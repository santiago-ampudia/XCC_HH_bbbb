### Generated Analysis

It has been shown that the widespread ML technique stacking generalization outperforms boosted decision trees in the context of Higgs classifications studies. However, this was in the context of Higgs decay to leptonic channels, considerably different from H->bb or H->gg, so it will not necessarily have the same performance. Its exploration may still be worth it [1612.07725].
