### Generated Analysis

Given the extreme differences in production rates for different topologies common in rare signal analysis such as di-Higgs events, you should improve the class imbalance handling for your di-Higgs analysis by implementing stratified sampling across all data splits, enhanced scale_pos_weight calculation with detailed logging and safety caps for extreme imbalances, and comprehensive class distribution monitoring that tracks imbalance ratios for each background vs signal dataset. That would ensure XGBoost pays appropriate attention to rare signal events and prevent validation sets from having insufficient signal representation. That is emphasized as crucial for improving classifier performance and reducing bias in imbalanced HEP datasets [2405.06040].
