**Thanks for your interest in the development of Delphes.**

The Delphes development model is community-based. Users willing to participate are encouraged to fork Delphes Git repository and to submit pull requests for improvements and bug fixes. The Delphes core development team from the [CP3 centre of the Universit√© catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/irmp/cp3) is in charge of the maintenance, releases, and general support to users via the ticket system.

Questions, suggestions and bug reports can be made through the [ticket system](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/report) available on our website. After checking that the issue is not already being adressed, you can [create a new ticket](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/newticket). Note that you will have to register first.

Documentation is collected in the [Workbook](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/wiki/WorkBook).  
A good starting point is the [Quick Tour](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/wiki/WorkBook/QuickTour).
